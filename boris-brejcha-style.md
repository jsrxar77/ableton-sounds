Boris Brejcha Style (High-Tech Minimal). 

Tempo & Tonality:
- BPM: 127 (lock tempo)
- Key/Scale: F# minor (Aeolian). Allowed color notes: G, A, B, C#, D, E, F#.
- Alternate mood option (if needed): E Phrygian (keep dark, exotic flavor).

Tracks (name, color, role, devices):
1) KICK — punchy, tight (909-style). Devices: Drum Rack + Drum Buss (drive low). Sub ~48–55 Hz, short tail, no flab.
2) CLAP/SNARE — sharp, wide on beats 2 & 4. Devices: Drum Rack, Glue Compressor (fast attack/medium release), subtle stereo widen >1 kHz.
3) HATS — off-beat open hat + 1/16 tick hats with light swing (~55%). Devices: Drum Rack, Auto Filter (HPF 200 Hz), light Saturator.
4) PERC — metallic/quirky percs for micro-fills at bars 7–8 and 15–16. Keep transient snappy.
5) BASS — aggressive mono rolling bass (saw/square blend), short decay, 1-2 semitone glide, sidechained to KICK. Devices: Wavetable/Operator + Saturator + EQ Eight (HP 28–32 Hz, notch boxiness ~250 Hz).
6) LEAD PLUCK — signature “formant/acid-y” pluck with band-pass movement; automate formant or peak filter slowly across the 16 bars. Devices: Wavetable/Analog + Auto Filter (BP), Phaser-Flanger, Echo (1/8 dotted sends).
7) STAB CHORD — short sus2/add9 stab for call-and-response with the lead; automate cutoff/resonance subtly.
8) FX — riser (bars 13–16), downlifter (bar 1), reverse vox-like one-shots (pitch-shifted) on transitions. Keep tasteful, not cinematic.
9) AMBIENCE/NOISE — thin noise bed sidechained to KICK, very low-level for glue.

Programming & Arrangement (DROP only):
- KICK: four-on-the-floor throughout.
- CLAP: 2/4, add 1-bar variation at bar 15 (flam or extra layer).
- HATS: classic off-beat + 1/16 patterns; occasional open-hat choke on bar 8 and 16.
- BASS: rolling 1/8 with syncopation at bars 4, 8, 12; keep root-centric (F#) with occasional b3/b7.
- LEAD: plucky motif, 1–2 bars, evolving via filter/formant automation (macro). Avoid “happy” major cadences.
- Fills: micro-glitch at bars 7–8 and 15–16 (perc or lead stutter).
- Energy curve: +2 dB perceived lift in bars 13–16 via parallel drum buss and opening filters.

Mix & Routing:
- Sidechain: BASS, LEAD, STAB, AMBIENCE → KICK (fast attack, musical release).
- Low-end mono below 150 Hz. Headroom: peak ≈ -6 dBFS.
- Drum Buss on DRUMS group (drive low, transient medium). Glue Comp on MIX BUS (2:1, slow attack, auto release, -1 dB GR).
- Keep space via delays/reverbs mostly on sends; no cavernous tails.

Session View (for ease of playback):
- Create one Scene named “BREJCHA_DROP_127_F#m” with all clips armed and color-coded.
- Each track: one 16-bar clip perfectly looped.

Constraints:
- Use stock Ableton devices when possible (Wavetable/Operator/Analog, Drum Rack, Drum Buss, Glue, Echo, Auto Filter, Saturator, EQ Eight).
- Deliver only the main drop loop; no mastering chain except light Glue on the bus.

Optional variations (if requested by the user later):
- BPM 126 or 128.
- Scale switch to E Phrygian for more exotic lead color.
- Add a second bass layer (mid-bass) sidechained, HPF at 120–150 Hz.

Output:
- Generate and arm all clips. Confirm tempo, key/scale, track names, and a one-line summary of the sound design choices used to achieve “High-Tech Minimal” character.
