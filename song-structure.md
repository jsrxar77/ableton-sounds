General Structure:

Each item in the structure should be organized as a row in the Ableton Live clips/Session View so it is easy to reproduce and perform.

- Intro (32–64 bars): minimal start with kick and light hi-hats or subtle percussion, designed for easy DJ mixing; layers build slowly with pads and filtered bass.
- First Build / Base Groove (64–128 bars): main warm, deep bassline enters; hypnotic beats and steady groove; energy settles without full melodies yet.
- First Breakdown (32–64 bars): beat cuts or bass gets filtered; atmospheres, melodic pads, processed vocals appear; serves as breathing space and preparation.
- Drop / Main Groove (64–128 bars): full beat returns; main melodic or harmonic elements come in; danceable, emotional, immersive textures.
- Second Breakdown (32–64 bars): energy drops; spacious effects, delays, reverbs; most introspective moment, setting up final climax.
- Climax / Main Drop (64–128 bars): full power with basslines, epic melodies, wide pads; progressive expansion with deep energy build, not explosive EDM-style drop.
- Outro (32–64 bars): layers fade out gradually; minimal beat or percussion remains for smooth DJ mix-out.
